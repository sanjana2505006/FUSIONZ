## ✨ About the Brand

YouthThreads is a youth-driven clothing brand aiming to redefine fashion for teenagers and young adults under 25.  
We believe that great style should be **affordable, trendy, responsible**, and **deeply connected** to the people who create it.

Our mission is rooted in two simple beliefs:

- Fashion should be **fresh, expressive, and effortless**.
- Growth should be **shared with the hands that help build it**.

We proudly collaborate with artisans and workers from **Pune, Haryana, Bihar, and Bangladesh**, breathing life back into local craftsmanship.  
Our collections are inspired by **Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and Gen Z** fashion waves — blending global vibes with homegrown dreams.

At YouthThreads, we are committed to:

- 🚀 **Same-Day Delivery** (because excitement shouldn't wait)
- 🔄 **48-Hour Return Policy** (because confidence comes with freedom)
- 💳 **Online Payments Only** (to ensure smooth and reliable order experiences)

Every thread we sew carries a dream. Every delivery we make carries a story.
